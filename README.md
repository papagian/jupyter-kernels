# jupyter-kernels

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are handy and elegant. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is awesome. These are some exercises to create containerized Jupyter kernels deployed in a cluster.

* [bash_kernel](https://github.com/papagian/jupyter-kernels/tree/master/bash_kernel) is an example of what happens if we combine Jupyter with Docker.

* [psql_kernel](https://github.com/papagian/jupyter-kernels/tree/master/psql_kernel) is an example of how bash_kernel can be easily extented to any docker image and interpreter.

* and [bash_k8s_kernel](https://github.com/papagian/jupyter-kernels/tree/master/bash_k8s_kernel) is an example of a kernel running in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.
